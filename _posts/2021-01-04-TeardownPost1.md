# Using MagicaVoxel to mod teardown 

* first I moved the boat model that i made with magicaVoxel to the mod folder <I>/steam/steammaps/common/teardown/mods/</I> and i chose to edit the island map.

* Then i added materials to this model. 
* The materials that we can use for the models in teardown are affecting the physics of and the destructibility of these models.

* After that we can find all the changed maps from the mods section inside of the game.
