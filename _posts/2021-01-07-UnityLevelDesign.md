# Getting Started with Pipeline Shader

* After downloading the HD render pipeline and adding pipeline asset to the graphics almost all the meshes turned into pink color. Their materials were not compatible with the render pipeline.

* Then i upgraded all materials and the materials were now compatible with the render pipeline.

* I used the box shapes and added Color Filter, Film Grain, Saturation, Bloom efects to each boxes.

* And I created an animation and made a Dolly to the right with the main camera to get inside of all the volume boxes and displayed different types of post processings that i made.
